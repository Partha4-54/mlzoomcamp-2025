# 🌌 Exoplanet Detection Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project detects **exoplanets** using **machine learning** by analyzing **light curve data** — the brightness of stars over time. When a planet passes in front of a star, the brightness briefly **drops**, known as a **transit**.  
I use **Kepler telescope data** to build an ML model that can predict whether a star has an exoplanet based on its light curve.

## 🧠 Problem Statement  
> **Can we use machine learning to automatically detect exoplanets  
> from light curve time-series data by analyzing transit dips?**
